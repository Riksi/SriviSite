						Originally from India, I obtained a PhD in Molecular Pharmacology from Northwestern University in 1996. Since then, I have worked in various research and scientific writing positions both in the biotech industry and in academia. Most recently, I worked in Stanford University, where I was part of team engaged in research into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of hearing loss.
						You can view my CV <a href = './cv.pdf'>here</a>.

						I have always enjoyed the challenges of hands-on research work but have also grown to realize the importance of effective communication in disseminating research findings to the larger scientific audience. I found it deeply satisfying to help others succeed with their manuscript submissions and grant applications. Indeed, I was always the go-to person for writing needs during my research career. So, now I am excited to offer these services to other scientists. I look forward to working with you and helping you achieve your writing goals!

						When I'm not working, I enjoy listening to Indian classical music, playing tennis, reading and exploring the beautiful San Francisco Bay Area, where I live with my family.
