	<p>
	I am a San Francisco based scientific editor and writer with 20 years of experience in all aspects of life science research, both in academia and the biotech industry. This includes planning and conducting experiments, data analysis, data presentation, manuscript writing, and grant writing. I have authored, co-authored, edited, and proofread manuscripts, letters of intent (LOIs), R21,RO1, and SBIR grant applications, abstracts, conference papers, theses, and peer-review responses. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I have a deep understanding of the peer-review process as it pertains to both manuscript and grant submissions. I understand the importance of effective communication in disseminating one's research findings to the larger scientific community, and will help you achieve your publication goals.
